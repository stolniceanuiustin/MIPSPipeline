MIPS Single-Cycle and Pipeline Processors

This repo contains my implementation of MIPS Single-Cycle and Pipeline processors, developed during my Computer Architecture class.

    Pipeline: Uses a 5-stage pipeline to improve performance. Simulated in Vivado 2024 using a testbench.

Both designs are implemented in VHDL using Vivado 2024.
Supported Instructions

    R-type: add, sub
    I-type: addi, subi, beq, bgez, lw, sw
